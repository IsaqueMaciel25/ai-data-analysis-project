## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd ai-data-analysis-project
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
- Place your raw data files in the `data/raw` directory.
- Run the `data_preprocessing.py` script to clean and preprocess the data.
- Use the `model_training.py` script to train your machine learning models.
- Evaluate the models using the functions in `evaluation.py`.
- Explore the analysis and insights in the `notebooks/analysis.ipynb`.
